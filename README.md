# DungeonEscape - 3D Game
A little project i started in 2013 or 2014, way before i even knew about proper use of source control.
A first person 3D maze puzzle game. Written in C# using XNA4.0 Framework.

Complete with level editor and localization support.

I also had an experimental Windows Phone port, but i never got it to run properly. For some reason it is also missing in great parts from this git. I hope to find it again
